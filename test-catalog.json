      "description": "The Invitae Multi-Cancer Panel analyzes 79 genes that are associated with hereditary cancers across eight major organ systems, including:\n* breast and gynecologic (breast, ovarian, uterine)\n* gastrointestinal (colorectal, gastric, pancreatic)\n* endocrine (thyroid, paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism)\n* genitourinary (renal/urinary tract, prostate)\n* skin (melanoma, basal cell nevus syndrome)\n* brain/nervous system \n* sarcoma\n* hematologic (myelodysplastic syndrome/leukemia)\n\nThe Invitae Multi-Cancer Panel is designed to maximize diagnostic yield for patients with a personal or family history of mixed cancers affecting these organ systems. The genes selected for this panel include the aggregate of primary genes from each of the individual cancer panels to provide clinically relevant information pertaining to cancers across all the organ systems.\n \nGenetic testing of these genes may confirm a diagnosis and help guide treatment and management decisions. Identification of a disease-causing variant would also guide testing and diagnosis of at-risk relatives. This test is specifically designed for heritable germline mutations and is not appropriate for the detection of somatic mutations in tumor tissue. \n",

The panel is designed to maximize diagnostic yield for patients with a personal or family history of mixed cancers affecting these organ systems.\n \nGenetic testing of these genes may confirm a diagnosis and help guide treatment and management decisions. Identification of a disease-causing variant would also guide testing and diagnosis of at-risk relatives. This test is specifically designed for heritable germline mutations and is not appropriate for the detection of somatic mutations in tumor tissue. ",

These genes were curated based on the available evidence to date to provide a comprehensive test for genes associated with X-linked CMT. Individuals with clinical signs and symptoms of CMT may benefit from diagnostic genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis, provide anticipatory guidance , help determine which relatives are at risk, or qualify affected patients to enroll in certain clinical trials. \n\nThis test covers genes that lead to an X-linked inheritance pattern (i.e., multiple generations are affected, transmission is not male-to-male, and males are generally more severely affected than females). Some clinicians may choose to order this test instead of the broader Invitae Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Comprehensive Panel to decrease the chance of detecting variants of uncertain significance. ",

      "description": "The Invitae Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy Panel analyzes up to 43 genes that are associated with an onset of seizures within the first 3 months of life. The most common types of seizures observed in individuals with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE, also known as Ohtahara syndrome) are isolated or clustered tonic spasms. Additional seizure types observed include asymmetric tonic and focal seizures. The classic EEG presentation observed in affected individuals is a suppression-burst pattern consisting of alternating medium-high voltage bursts followed by flat suppression interburst intervals. The majority of EIEE cases evolve into West syndrome between 4\u20136 months of age, with continuing infantile spasms and the observation of developmental delays and a characteristic EEG pattern of hypsarrhythmia. Later in childhood, between 1\u20133 years of age, EIEE can develop into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\n\nSignificant clinical and genetic heterogeneity exists in EIEE, making it difficult to use phenotype as the sole criterion to point at a definitive cause. Comprehensive panel testing allows for an efficient evaluation of multiple potential genes based on a single clinical indication for testing. Identification of the molecular basis of EIEE in an affected individual may confirm diagnosis, predict prognosis, inform treatment options, and encourage testing of additional family members to inform reproductive risk.",

This panel provides comprehensive testing\u2014particularly for the Rett/Angelman syndrome spectrum, which includes several disorders in the differential diagnosis. These syndromic disorders present with seizures, developmental delay, speech and language delays, intellectual disability, and variable congenital anomalies. These genes were curated based on the available evidence to date to provide comprehensive analysis for syndromic seizure disorders.\n\nGiven the clinical overlap between different syndromic epilepsy disorders, comprehensive panel testing allows for a more efficient evaluation of multiple conditions based on a single indication for testing. Individuals with clinical features suggestive of a syndromic neurodevelopmental epilepsy disorder may benefit from diagnostic genetic testing to establish or confirm a diagnosis, predict prognosis, inform medical management, and encourage testing of additional family members to inform reproductive risk.",

Cilia are necessary for proper cellular motility, for the movement of material around a cell, and for chemical signaling pathways. Pathogenic variants in these genes impair the function of cilia and are described as a class of pediatric developmental disorders known as ciliopathies.\n\t\nMolecular genetic testing for ATD can provide patients with a definitive diagnosis when skeletal dysplasias such as Sensenbrenner syndrome or Mainzer-Saldino syndrome are being considered as differential diagnoses. There is also overlap between ATD and other ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome. With the molecular determination of the patient\u2019s phenotype, precise clinical care and monitoring can be administered.

Gillespie syndrome is also caused by pathogenic variants in PAX6 and is characterized by aniridia, cerebellar ataxia, and mental retardation. In addition, pathogenic variants in PAX6 have been implicated in disorders with findings such as coloboma, cataracts, keratitis, foveal hypoplasia, optic nerve hypoplasia, and Peters anomaly. \n\nThis assay does not include deletion/duplication testing for the region surrounding PAX6; therefore, it cannot differentiate between deletions restricted to PAX6 and deletions that also include WT1 and cause Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies and mental retardation (WAGR) syndrome. If a deletion of PAX6 is identified, then additional testing that includes copy number analysis should be performed to determine whether WT1 is deleted and the individual has an increased risk for Wilms tumor.\n\nAnalysis of the PAX6 gene may help guide treatment and management decisions. Identification of a disease-causing variant would also guide testing and diagnosis of at-risk relatives.",
